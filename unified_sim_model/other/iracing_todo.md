- Correcly know if a car is on track or not using TrkLoc
- Get rid of pace car
- current lap time should be localy timed even if its wrong.
- time to leader is relative to the pace car which is wrong.
- Positions dont work.

Generaly:
- Best lap should maybe not index into the lap list.
That way we can have a valid best lap even if it isnt present in the lap list
